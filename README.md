If you do not have Python installed yet, it is recommended that you install the [Official](https://www.python.org/) distribution of Python. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `TestandTrain.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `covid_database.csv` dataset file to complete your work.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `azratuni/Thesis` (shahib-branch) (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook TestandTrain.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook TestandTrain.ipynb
```
or open with Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified COVID-19 patients' dataset consists of 1002 data points, with each datapoint having 25 features.
